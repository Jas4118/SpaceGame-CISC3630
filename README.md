# SpaceGame
SpaceGame creation for CISC 3630. Jason Li
Professor Lawrence Goetz.
This game was created with Clickteam Fusion and took way too long for me to figure out how to create the application. But basically this game was just a test as I spent sometime playing around and had some issues with audio becoming really bad. But you would click on the sprites in the screen and shoot down and it would destroy the objects and in the end a restart button would appear.
